## Introduction

This project focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained open-source language models to simplify German text. Text simplification aims to make written content more accessible to a broader audience, including individuals with reading difficulties or non-native speakers.

## Objectives

- To explore the effectiveness of various pre-trained language models for the task of text simplification in German.
- To develop a fine-tuning methodology that enhances the model's ability to generate simplified text.
- To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models using quantitative and qualitative metrics.
